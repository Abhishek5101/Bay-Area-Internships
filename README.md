# Bay-Area-Internships

This is a list of large tech companies or their subsidiaries that can (in theory) hire non-US summer interns in the Bay Area.

Internships are 3-month long interviews. It's hard for non-US citizens to find US-based internships because after your "interview" finishes, converting you into a full-time employee is difficult due to visa uncertainties and lotteries. If the company is international and/or highly distributed, you have a much higher chance of being hired as an intern in the Bay Area as you could then just go and work from one of their offices outside of the US, if successful.

I want to share the list I made that I referred to in Autumn 2018 when looking for summer internships in the States.

If you'd like to add something in here, or update a non-international company, Pull Requests and Issues are very much accepted!
